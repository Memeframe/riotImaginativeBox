# Riot's Imaginative Box
Riot's Imaginative Box is a mod for Terraria that aims to provide tons of fun weapons and items to your Terraria experience.
 These are based on "global items", meaning you get the Vanilla Terraria experience with more content to play around with. 
 Each item and weapon is tailored with fun and balance in mind.
 
 The mod adds a plethora of weapons, items and accessories to further boost your Terraria experience. They are designed with the original
 Vanilla experience in mind, but mod compatibility is not an issue. No other mod will be required to install Riot's Imaginative Box.

It is currently still in testing and creation phase, namely
"Update 0.4" - 6 weapons, 2 items, 4 projectiles
Daily progress is made on the mod, but a release date is uncertain. I'll continue to add little easter eggs and content for the pacient to enjoy.
